Some ideas for redeems
----------------------

Spawn ermsharks

Start Ermcon

Swarm Vedal with multiple Anneels

spawn 50 ermfish

no UI / markers for 30 seconds

play shadow leviathan/other creature sound / fake leviathan sounds

Turn on/off the ALERT circle on items

Switch jukebox to [Song Selection]

Invert control

Replace the crosshair with the redeemer's choice of any image

Some kind of quest kind of thing "Kill 5 erm sharks before 2 minutes or you will die" Maybe just lose a lot of life instead of die? Something like that?

play a choice of ermfish soundbites

fake crush depth or oxygen alerts

Speed up everything/slow down everything

Decrease/increase player and/or seatruck speed. He's been complaining about how slow the vehicle is. Could help him out.

on screen message

Can you teleport vedal outside of his prawn like he got hit by a warper teleport ball?

Kill Vedal

Show a random piece of Vedal femboy Fanart as a jumpscare

LOUDEST SCREAM (Bass boosted)

make the game save, i'm sure the chat will love that one

PTSD: For 120 seconds progressively summon more and more ermsharks and then cull them all at the end of the duration

Rename all the items in his game. Or just the ones in his inventory. Edit the lore descriptions and make them silly?? Idk

Detach seatruck module
